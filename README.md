# MTSL- Multi-Task Sequence Labeling Toolkit
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Code by **Thai-Hoang Pham** at Ohio State University.

## 1. Introduction
**MTSL** is a Python implementation of the multi-task sequence labeling models described in a paper [Multi-Task 
Learning with Contextualized Word Representations for Extented Named Entity Recognition] 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10118). This toolkit is used for learning one main sequence labeling task with one 
auxiliary sequence labeling task and neural language model. It can work with uncontextualized word embeddings 
(GloVe) or contextualized word embeddings (ELMo). There are three main multi-task sequence labeling models in 
this toolkit including embedding-shared model, RNN-shared model, and hierarchical-shared model. Figure 1 shows the
architectures of these multi-task models.

Our system achieves an F1-score of 83.35% which is a state-of-the-art  result for fine-grained named entity 
recognition (FG-NER) task. The following table shows the performance of **MTSL** when learning FG-NER task with other 
sequence labeling tasks.

## 2. Installation

This toolkit requires Python 3.6 and depends on Numpy, Scipy, Pytorch, and AllenNLP packages. You must have them 
installed before using **MTSL**.

The simple way to install them is using pip:

```sh
	$ pip install -U numpy scipy pytorch allennlp
```

**Note**: You need to create **embedding** folder inside **data** folder and put embedding files into this folder before
using **MTSL** toolkit. For Glove embeddings: download embedding file from 
[here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). For ELMo embeddings: download weight and option files from 
[here](https://allennlp.org/elmo).

## 3. Usage

### 3.1. Data

The input data's format of **MSTL** follows CoNLL format. In particular, it consists of two columns: one column for word 
and then another for label. The table below describes an example sentence in chunking corpus (CoNLL-2000).

| Word             | Label |
|------------------|-------|
| His              | B-NP  |
| firm             | I-NP  |
| ,                | O     |
| along            | B-PP  |
| with             | B-PP  |
| some             | B-NP  |
| others           | I-NP  |
| ,                | O     |
| issued           | B-VP  |
| new              | B-NP  |
| buy              | I-NP  |
| recommendations  | I-NP  |
| on               | B-PP  |
| insurer          | B-NP  |
| stocks           | I-NP  |
| yesterday        | B-NP  |
| .                | O     |

**Note**: Only chunking corpus is provided in this toolkit.
